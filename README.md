Loved Ones Image Classifier
The Loved Ones Image Classifier is a machine learning project that aims to automatically identify and classify the individuals in a folder of photos containing pictures of family and friends. The project utilizes scikit-learn, a powerful and easy-to-use machine learning library in Python, to train a model on a labeled dataset of images.

Project Overview
The project is designed to provide a quick and accurate identification of loved ones in large collections of photos, with potential applications in family and social gatherings, personal photo organization, and more. The project uses advanced techniques such as data augmentation and feature selection to extract meaningful features from the images. Once trained, the model can be used to predict the individuals in new photos.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, you will need to:

Install Python 3 and scikit-learn library.
Prepare a labeled dataset of images of family and friends.
Train the model on the labeled dataset using the scikit-learn library.
Use the trained model to predict the individuals in new photos.
Usage
To use the Loved Ones Image Classifier, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository to your local machine.
Prepare a folder of images containing pictures of family and friends.
Run the classify.py script with the path to the folder as an argument.
The script will automatically classify the individuals in the images and output the results.
Conclusion
The Loved Ones Image Classifier is a useful tool for quick and accurate identification of loved ones in large collections of photos. The project uses advanced machine learning techniques to extract meaningful features from the images and is designed to be easy to use.
